          <p class="question-heading">1. Making An ethical decision</p>
           <!-- Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
            the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. -->
          <p>
             When I resigned from work, I gave work an extra 2 weeks notice. Majority of my clients asked
             about doing "cashies" or to continue looking after them privately. I explained my non-compete
             and said I couldn't help, even though they suggested it be "remote" etc...<br><br>
             This was incredibly hard for me to do as I've spent 14 years building and supporting my schools
              / clients and they have always felt and been treated like 'my' clients. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The reality is that the clients paid my employer, not me and although I had the history, relationshp 
            and trust with the client, I was always operating under a company. This makes doing private work
            not only illegal but extremely unethical. My entire reputation was built on trust as well skillset.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, I will always know what I have done and I have to live with it. Always telling the
            truth means you never have to "remember" lies. Always speak the truth and you'll never have to worry about
            keeping track of details / lies. 
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">2. Influencing my values and identity</p>
          <p>
            I grew going to church and had the concept of "being accountable for your actions" drilled in to me. 
            Having an all power being watch your every move and record it in a book taught me to always do good 
            and the right thing. I also left my old South African life at 18 and hit the reset button in N.Z. 
            Having to start again taught me to always appreicate what you have and never take things or people for
            granted. <br><br>My parents raised me to always do your job like you owned the company. This was great 
            for getting hired but terrible for work / life balance. Work always won.<br><br>My parents also taught
            me to be compassionate to fellow humans. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="question-heading">3. My Strengths</p>
          <p>
            I can talk to almost anyone about anything. This strength is helping me get to know my Homegroup, 
            make friends and some really cool co-coders. It is also going to help when presenting projects etc...
            unless another team mate would like to practise their talking skills. :) <br><br>
            I am very empathic and compassionate which makes understanding other people's pain and frustration
            along the journey is going to create some very relatable experiences. I am hoping to use this to help
            emotionally support fellow students and help be a cheerleader for them where possible.  
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">4. Limitations</p>
          <p>
            My biggest weakness is being really bad with time. I am currently 20 hours behind on a filming project due 15th September.
            Some how in the absolute last minute I will pull it off (no idea how that keeps happening). It is extremely 
            taxing emotionally and causes stress around the house. This is not fair to my animals and fiancé. I am getting better
            at just saying "no" to various distractions, especially during my study period. My goal is to be 100% caught up before the end of September. :)
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">5. Co-work Drama</p>
          <p>
            I have had very little (if any) tension / conflict at work. I have always made sure everyone on a project was accountable
            and held to the standard we expect for the clients. This has lead me to reflect and I found some examples of a difficult situation.<br><br>
            Working so closely with schools and having a 14 year relationship lead to several schools having issues with my company when I said
            I was leaving. Some principals said they were leaving the company and they would only deal with me etc... They thought it was a compliment
            to me but rather it came off as insulting other engineers they had never met. I spent 2 weeks hand-holding clients to make the change
            from dealing with me directly, to using a helpdesk system with other staff. This was more client > staff conflict.
