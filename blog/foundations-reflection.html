           <p class="question-heading">3 New Things About Me and Ego</p>
           <p>
            1. Time Management is hard. Using Timeboxes + TOGL is still really foreign to me. Without having a set time / client appointment or structure, clicking START just wasn't happening like it said on the box.<br>
            2. JavaScript eats time! I know it's not JavaScript it's actually deep diving into problems / troubleshooting. Focusing and concentrating makes time disappear. This is also because I find it fun trying to solve
            problems with coding. Trying out the different pieces, looking for help only and especially talking to people.
            3. I am always down for a conversation. This is a double edged sword. It can be great making small talk / relationship building / providing emotional comfort food. It can also be bad if trying to focus and meet
            deadlines. It is something I need to fine-tune. 
           </p>
           <p class="question-heading">Roles of Value, Empathy & Self-Awareness</p>
           <p>
            All our decisions, choices, opinions come from our belief system and our values. Do you believe something is possible, do you believe in your own abilities? These all help guide and direction us in life. When
            it comes to learning it is very important to be comfortable not knowing something. The Hierarchy of Competence shows us that at the very base, we have unconscious incompetence, meaning we don't know that we 
            don't know something. Being self-ware helps us accept this and then work towards conscious incompetence (knowing that we don't know). <br>
            Sometimes we also need to have empathy for our self as well as others. <br>
            Empathy for others helps foster betting working relationships and much better understanding. They say: "Always be kind to those you meet because you have no idea the demons they may be fighting". Something like that.
            To answer the original question a little bit more directly:<br>
            Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness are all tools in our emotion intelligence toolkit that we can use to console.log() out our thoughts, while inspecting others (with kindness) all so that we can return() better 
            outcomes... both in personal and professional areas of our lives.

           <p class="question-heading">Bottom Of The Core Learning Cereal Box</p>
           <p>
            My biggest surprise was how detalied the Core learnings were in EDA. I love that! I wasn't sure what my expectation was, but I do know the Core content exceeded that expectation. It's been inspiring. Soft skills
            are my jam. 
           <p class="question-heading">Core Learning Challenges a.k.a Not JavaScript</p>
           <p>
            No big challenges. I have spent many years building a relationship with myself, learning to listen to the voice in my head that says "this isn't right" and forming a deep understanding of my processes etc...
            I think articulating my points in writing is a challenge. I can talking and when I get into the Flow (thanks Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi), then words just come out in a stream. I do my best thinking / planning
            to an audience of one.  
           </p>
           <p class="question-heading">We Core, Therefore We Are (Why EDA Cores)</p>
           <p>
            EDA cores because the mission is to create job-ready developers. This means having the skillset of technical as well as emotional intelligence. I think Core helps people make better decisions. Me, for example, I was
            just about to finish (yes I started typing it for ages) a story about someone I dated who could not take feedback and the story was great... it has drama, comedy, a lesson... Aesop would be taking notes... BUT, 
            using my newly refreshed core skills, I did some reflecting and it's really not fair or nice to use someone (even removing their names) in a story like that. Don't you just love seeing new teachings happening
            right in front of you? Amazing. 
           </p>
           <p class="question-heading">To Core, Or Not To Core</p>
           <p>
            The Core has been a great use of time! I don't know if you know this BUT by having Core and Tech parts, gives students options to bounce between the left and right brain working during the week.<br>
            It's genius... but you already knew that...
            EDA Senpais.... we see you... :D <br>
            On a serious note, Core Core Core some more. I think this was an absolute must. It has helped alot of students that are heavy on the tech, have to reach inside themselves and dig a little deeper. <br>
            I feel the time on Core was a must. We can buy courses, books, watch YouTube videos to keep the coding edge sharp. Having guided Core work that we could not find so easily is like striking gold on your first
            go. So inclosing.... I would like to justify my answer on why I think Core is not a waste of time, but the EDA core curriculum justifies itself.
