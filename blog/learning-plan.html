           <p class="question-heading">Long term goal or career pathway</p>
            <p>My long term goal is to refine my skills and make a difference in the world. I love working with kids and watching
              there faces light up as they "get it". I want to find a workplace with the culture of doing good in the world. When 
              I go to sleep at night 
            </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Learning Strengths and Limitations</p>
            <p>
              I have a good memory and process data very quickly. I learn to teach so I always make sure to try and fully
              understand a topic before moving on. I also like to bring people together and create an beat friendly environment
              that hopefully will encourage sharing of information and get students teaching students in a fun productive way.<br><br>
              Limitations is time. I always tend to help others before myself which leads to commiting my time to other people. This
              leads to rushing and constantly playing catchup. I thrive under preasure and stress is but a light snack for me, which means
              I often get out of tight situations by sheer luck or because of being 'likeable'. Not a good long term strategy.
            </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Human Skill development</p>
            <p>
              Time management and taking a step back from always helping and being the 'go to' person. I want to step back and 
              watch other classmates shine. I want to be able to focus better. So time and focus. This is a perfect example. I started
              with 'time' and then peppered in 'focus'. My brain is constantly firing off random thoughts / images / sounds / music at
              any given time. This is pretty distracting sometimes. Final answer: <span style="color: #5fe886;">Focus powers.</span>
            </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Commitment to managing workload at EDA
            <p>
              I have been playing to take the EDA jump for 5+ years. I've also left a well paying job that required maybe 50% of my 
              brain power which lead to not having as much meaning as it should. I have committed to the program because I want to change 
              my path and career. I have a wee human coming and I need to lead by example. I have set my mind to this task and I will do 
              everything in my power to stay on top of everything. I love a good plan and having the bootcamp plan in advance means I've already
              got my calendars set, Siri is helping (homepods in all the rooms) and daily checkins with my HG and fiancé. <br><br>
              My best friend also checks in with my all time and stresses the commitment and urgency of this program. :D 
            </p>
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Commitment to timely seeking help
            <p>
              I like talking to people and that includes my HG and Facilitators. When I get stuck on something I say:<br>
              <span style="color: #5fe886;">"Hey Siri set a problem solver timer for 30 minutes"</span><br>
              This forces me to have a constraint. Once the 30 min timers go off I reach out to my HG. I am blessed to have an amazing
              Homegroup. If my Homegroup can't help, then:
              <br>1. we all learn as a HG once I found the solution. 
              <br>2. I post in tech-questions.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Expectation of Facilitation team
            <p>
              My expectations are small and simple. Help me achieve my dreams and change my live for the better. Luckily this can be
              achieved by just being there as training wheels and mentors to provide the encouragement need to meet the challenges. <br><br>
              I believe that being self-motivated is a big key to success. I also know that some days the universe / world just seems to
              attack you from every direction. Having someone to talk to and expressive your issues is extremely helpful. A little catharsis
              goes a long way.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p class="question-heading">Scheduling commitments
            <p>
              I know that my time is my biggest asset / weakness at the moment. I have strong values pulling me to towards family as well
              as being highly conscientious.<br><br>
              My commitments are:<br>
              I have a pregnant fiancé.<br>
              I have lots of animals.<br> 
              Creating education STEM content for teachers and students.<br></br>
              I am blessed to only require 4 hours sleep and still be able to perform at peak. I have contacted everyone involved 
              and expressed my Bootcamp schedule. This schedule is set in stone. <br>
              The ONLY thing that is unknown is the birth of my 1st born. I have to be there for my partner and baby. Once baby is here
              I will be partner and baby during lunches. I have a bassinet ready in my study so baby can sleep here during lectures.<br>
              We have family and a great support network to help out.
