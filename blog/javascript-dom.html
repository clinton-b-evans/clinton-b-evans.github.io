          <p class="question-heading">1. Analogy of Javascript?</p>
          <p>
            Javascript makes a website <span class="cyan">interact</span> with you. Imagine a book of great puns. The HTML would be all
            the words in the book and the CSS would be all the illustrations / pictures. Javascript would be the 
            <span class="cyan">dirty</span> <span class="green">magic</span> that could get the book to:<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp a. turn it's pages by itself.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp b. pop up saying "never share these" or "think before you post".<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp c. Greet you and tell you what day it is today.<br><br>
            Any time the website needs to do more than just
            be there, Javascript comes in to play. <br><br>
            Imagine if this pun book was a real page turner, like a book on gravity you struggle to put down, and you wanted to save the 
            best puns, you could touch (cause it's a book remember) the word and Javascript could
            make a list called <span class="purple">"turbo puns"</span> that you could keep adding all your favourite puns to.<br><br>
            Javascript is like using a mouse for the first time, it becomes really useful when it clicks.

          <p class="question-heading">2. Control Flow and Loops</p>
          <p>₪ Make Good Decisions ₪</p>
          <p>With EQ fresh on the mind, this is the perfect time to explain control flows and loops. I am going to start with loops.<br><br>
            Have you ever had the same thought over and over... from like a time you did something in highschool, randomly pop into your brain
            at 3am? That's a loop. It usually continues until you get out of bed and kiss sleep good bye or you fall asleep. <br>
            For computer programming languages loops work a little like that. There are two key words when talking about loops:<br>
            1. <span class="cyan">For loops</span> <br>
            2. <span class="green">While loops</span><br><br>
            <span class="cyan">For loops</span> are when you have to do the same thing over and over for a <span class="cyan">set amount of times</span>.
            Example: <br><br>
            I have 5 unpaid bills in the mail (or email). <br>
            My 1st of the month habit is like this:<br>
            1. Open bill <br>
            2. Cry<br>
            3. Pay bill<br>
            4. <a href="https://youtu.be/gV7lz6wCcfM?t=3" target="_blank">->Recover</a><br><br>
            LUCKILY this will only happen to me <span class="cyan">5 </span> times. I know this because I only have <span class="cyan">5</span> bills. I can bank of only having to go through
            this 5 times. Like the moon, loops have a darkside. If I left my code with numberOfBills = <span class="cyan">5</span>, then I would never pay anything more than
            <span class="cyan">5</span> bills (sounds amazing). It's best practise to set the counter of the loop to the numberOfBills (or the length of the array)<br>
            That's where the <span class="cyan">dirty</span> <span class="green">magic</span> comes in. Our  <span class="cyan">For loop</span> will run for as mnany times
            as there are bills. This means if I only have 1 bill, the loop runs once. <span class="flashing-orange">Amazing.</span>
             <br><br>
            <span class="green">While loops</span> are when you have a condition rather than a set number. <br>
            For example my dog has this <span class="green">while loop</span> when he has just had a nightmare.<br>
            While human cannot be seen:<br>
            ----- bark as loud as possible <br>
            ----- wait 30 seconds <br><br>
            Those two things are repeated until I come through and cuddle him. A techie example could be:<br>
            Your online messenger could do something like that: <br>
            While "typing", show 3 dots movings <br><br>
            You ever said something stupid to someone and then those 3 bouncy dots just tourment you for hours (although it was only 2 minutes of wait time).
            There's another human loops: <br>
            While waiting for reply: (while reply = none)<br>
            ---- check phone for reply<br>
            ---- experience massive amounts of anxiety <br><br>
            </p>
            This is the perfect time for a segway into:
            <p>
              Control Flows: <br>
              If is a wonderful word. Hope, promise, a better tomorrow. All of these stem from an IF statement. In Javascript IF statements are just
              if this then that control flows. Look at the above example:<br>
              You text someone and ask them on a date<br>
              While waiting for reply: (while reply = none) <br>
              ---- check phone for reply<br>
              ---- <span class="green">if reply is yes then : <br>
              ---- ____ dance and rejoice<br></span>
              ---- <span class="red">if reply is no then : <br>
              ---- ____ sadness and fall down<br></span>
              ---- or else (aka while still waiting)<br>
              ---- ____experience massive amounts of anxiety <br>
            </p>

          <p class="question-heading">3. DOM. What is it good for?</p>
          <p>
            "Everything the website touches is our kingDOM." Mufasa - 1994 <br><br>
            The DOM is the Document Object Model (how many times you read that this week?)<br>
            It bascially makes all the things on your webpage a manipulatable ... object.<br><br>
            The heading, the paragraphs, the links, etc... all objects.<br>
            We could write some make code that finds all the headers on the page, 
            say some h1s and change their class or even what they say. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            You wanna know a secret? You've been in the DOM this whole time. Remember the first time 
            you went on the internet and got a pop up ad? All Javascript. There was a script that triggered
            a link in a new window. Sneaky right? <br>
            We don't use Javascript for evil though, we use it to: <br>
            -- update shopping carts <br>
            -- do math like adding totals <br>
            -- find local singles in our area. No, that's a pop up. Damn<br>
          </p><br>
          <p class="question-heading">4. Arrays vs Objects</p>
          <p>
            An <span class="cyan">Array</span> is a list. <br>
            An <span class="green">Object</span> is a thing with specific defined properties<br><br>
            let playlist = ['jams','doof doof music','rad jams','zero-cool']<br><br>
            This is an array. We can return the value of each item in the list by using it's index number. Just remember that computers start at 0
            rather than 1. So to return 'jams' we do this <br>
            console.log(playlist[0])<br>
            Computers count from 0. So 0 is our 1st object.<br>
            console.log(playlist[3])<br>
            returns zero-cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Objects on the other hand are well objects. You define the object attributes (things it will have) like:<br>
            puppy = { <br>
              &nbsp&nbsp name: 'Chester'<br>
              &nbsp&nbsp age: '11.5 months'<br>
            } <br>
            And how old is puppy? We find out by using the key (name of property) like so:<br><br>
            console.log(puppy.name) <br>
            'Chester'<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="question-heading">5. Functions</p>
          <p>
            Functions are reusable bits of code. Short and sweet. <br>
            Ok, you want more, try this. In life we end up doing so many things every day <br>
            Imagine writing step by step what you did each day. Often there would great repetition<br>
            In Google Docs, there would be so much copying and pasting going on<br>
            That's like functions. We could make a function called coffeeMe(). <br>
            This would get us to do the following:<br><br>
            1. Fill Jug <br>
            2. Boil Jub<br>
            3. Fill Cup with coffee<br>
            4. Pour in hot water<br>
            5. Add noms (milk, sugar, honey, happy thoughts)<br>
            6. Return coffee<br><br>
            You see what functions help us? Now when we want coffee, we don't type all that out, we just 
            type out the function to call it. like so:<br>
            coffeeMe()<br><br>
            Did you know that console.log is a built in Javascript FUNCTION!! <br>
          You've been using functions all this time Harry! <br>
