              <p class="question-heading">1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
            </p>
            Emotional Intelligence is the measurement of your understanding and/or control your and/or others' emotions.<br>
            Think <span class="green">Aang</span>, but <span class="green">emotion bending</span>. It's like this:<br>
            The Latin derivative for the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy in motion. Having a higher <span class="green">EQ</span> allows you
            to notice this flow inside yourself, and start to see it in others.<br><br>
            The following are some examples of tools of <span class="green">EQ</span>:<br>
            Self Reflecting | Self Soothing | Empathy<br><br>
            <span class="green">Self Reflecting:</span> I was annoyed at the cat, I dropped my wallet, that's why I got short with the sales person. I was 
            feeling a plethora of emotions and took it out on them. I was wrong and I can do better.<br><br>
            <span class="green">Self Soothing:</span> My emotions cannot be greater than me because they are me. I create and manage my emotions.
            All of them. This too shall pass. It's going to be good. Life is good.<br><br>
            <span class="green">Empathy:</span> I can recall what it was like to have low self esteem so I can imagine what this person is saying when they tell 
            me about their insecurities. They are being very brave and trusting. I can see what they are going through.
            <br><br>
            Here is a cliche, I mean, a classic example:<br>
            Someone cuts you off in trafic.
            <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/the-science-behind-road-rage-and-why-normal-people-become-assholes-on-the-road-2768c90c581b" target="_blank">->Road Rage</a> kicks in.<br>
            You're about to lose it and you can feel the rage monster take over. Having a high <span class="green">EQ</span> would allow you to take that rage monster and say:<br>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/h0-WO6xRbAo?t=15" class="cyan" target="_blank">->"Daddy, Chill"</a><br>
            You could channel the anger (or flow of emotions) elsewhere or allow it to leave your body and dissipate. Once the anger
            has been checked, you can start with the reasoning. <span id="yellowp">You might remind yourself to be kind to people and that you have no idea
            what other people are going through</span>. The other reminder is that you getting angry will not solve anything.<br><br>
            At the end of the day feelings are a super strong driving force behind our human behaviour. This is why it makes sense to 
            try understand our feelings as best as possible. <br>
            <br>
            <br>  
          <p class="question-heading">2. How is it different to IQ?</p>
          <p>
            How can we conceptualize intelligence? Let me try:<br>
            IQ is like the CPU and RAM of a computer. It your brains processing power and working memory, so to speak. This makes itself visible when 
            problem solving or reasoning. Recognizing patterns is another indicator. <br><br>
            The difference between <span class="cyan">IQ</span> and <span class="green">EQ</span> I could joke is this:<br>
            You meet someone with a high <span class="cyan">IQ</span> you walk away thinking<br>"<span id="yellowp">They are an interesting person</span>"<br>
            You meet someone with a high <span class="green">EQ</span> you walk away thinking<br>"<span id="yellowp">I am an interesting person</span>"<br><br>
            People with a higher <span class="green">EQ</span> can (most of the time using their power for good) make you feel great and special. They communicate with you
            speaking your language, you feel understood. You can "talk" to these people. Real talk. Life is good. <br>
             
            
          <p class="question-heading">3. Why is EQ important</p>
          <p>
            <span class="green">EQ</span> is often sited to be more important that IQ. If you were to ask teenagers the following question: <br>
           <span class="cyan">Would you rather be LIKED or SMART?<br>
           What do you think the answer would be? <br>
           What would your answer be? <br></span>
           <span class="green">EQ</span> is very important because when we were learning and getting taught as younglings, the teachers that made us feel
           the best were often our "favourites". Having someone that can help manage your emotions and feelings is really helpful. In the work place having
           a manager that you can talk to and feel comfortable with will help immensely. It helps create a great workplace culture as well.<br><br>
           Technical concept you could: look up online, watch a video, ask for help. Imagine trying to do that while you're stressing about 
           work / you have gotten some unexpected family news / you turned on the news and saw the state of the world. <span class="green">EQ</span> will help you deal with all of
           that.
