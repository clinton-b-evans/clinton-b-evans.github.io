            Hi Non-Technical Friend! Appologies but the handbook made me call you that. I know you're technical
            cause otherwise how else did you get this link? I'm going to tell you about this time I got stuck
            on something as silly as pulling the plastic tag off of a drink bottle before you can drink.
           </p>
            <p>
              I was writing some software for a friend using Django.<br>
              It did lots of clever math for property investing.<br>
              I was trying to loop through a tuple and it was not having a bar of it. I used to write this code
              between 10pm and 12am during the week so I wasn't the freshest. <br><br>
              I eventually solved it by using the python REPL and trying to loop through the data manually before pushing it.<br>
              I knew what I wanted. I told my dog what I was trying to do. He did not even offer a paw of support. Just the
              blank souless stare of a cavalier. <br><br>
              During the coding phase I felt annoyed but 
              when I got there in the end I felt <br>
              <a href="https://youtu.be/2BRXmgcBHBM?t=46">-> great. Smarter, more aggressive. </a>I felt like I could take on the world.

          <p class="question-heading">Elegant Solution</p>
            <p>
              I recently had to code some JavaScript graphs for said friend. It was such a pain. 
              Using Python to get values on the backend was easy. When I added the value into the graph it 
              would just JavaScript fail(TM). You know... one little mistake and the entire JS file doesn't work. <br>
              If only there was a way to display bugs in the console. <br><br>
              My technique was to fill in the values in the JavaScript manually. <br>
              Get the Python code to push the values in the EXACT way JavaScript wanted it. <br>
              I wrote a function that took in the math and returned it formatted to work. <br>
              I knew I could do this and that I just had to get the write formatting. <br><br>
              A lot of the numbers had "currency" formats and the graph for some reason did not like 
              ", or .00" which is what broke it. <br> The function took value, dropped the "," and ".00"<br>
              This allowed the graph to work and display the correct data. <br><br>
              I knew I could solve this during the coding which gave me the push to follow through.<br>
              Solving this made me feel great, especially seeing working graphs on an app.<br>
              Everyone knows that numbers aren't worth anything unless they are in a graph.
