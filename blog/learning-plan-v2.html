           <p>
            After foundations I am more keen an ever to get out there to see how being a developer can do more good in the world and find a meaningful career.<br>
            Being self-taught in everything, I never had an uni experience so I never knew how much I'd enjoy the studnet life, albeit online. It is still really cool.

           <p class="question-heading">Bootcamp Strengths and Limitations</p>
           <p>
            My biggest issue is stressing about lectures when the baby comes. Babies don't have the best time management. I know it will most likely be Week 3 - 4 so I've 
            had a peek at the week's work and I feel confident I can catch up. Weekends, Sleep. Psssssh just words. I mean I could try code along with a lecture in a maternity 
            wards... would that be an EDA first? 
           </p>
           <p class="question-heading">Biggest Non-technical Challenge</p>
           <p>
            Time management and being highly conscientious. I've set such a high expectation of myself. I think I am cut from the cloth that can weather any storm. 
           </p>
           <p class="question-heading">Human Skills I'd Like To See</p>
           <p>
            Setting realistic expectations and being better with Time Box Models.

           <p class="question-heading">Expectation from Team Bootcamp</p>
           <p>
            Teach me the ways. Keep me informed re: my work. Be as amazing as the foundations team is.

           <p class="question-heading">Expectation From Team Me</p>
           <p>
            Come to class. Learn. Code. Sleep. Repeat. Besides the various Apple and Microsoft certs I've achieved (that expire after x years... thanks IT industry) this 
            will be my first and only NZQA cert. I am very excited to add more letters to my name, so to speak.
