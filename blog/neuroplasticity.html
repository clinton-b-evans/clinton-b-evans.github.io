           <p class="question-heading">Squishy Brains</p>
            <p>Brains are pretty cool things! We all have them. We all use them (although 5 minutes in any comment sections will 
              having you doubing this).<br>
              Neuroplasticity can refer to the brain's change through growth and reorganisation. I like to sum it up as:
              The more you use it, the better it gets.<br><br>
              In this wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJL3gjc8ak" target="_blank">-> TED Talk Dr. Kelly Lambert</a> talks about brains and Neuroplasticity. <br>
              One take away that got me really thinking was 
              that brains control movement as well as thinking. Over the years our culture has changed and sitting slumped 
              infront of screens (especially since C19) is just another day. Exercise and physically 
              moving your body helps the brain. WAT?! I know right? <br>
              <br>
              So I did this experiment this week:<br>
              During JavaScript fun week there was lots of challenges. As soon as I got stuck I stepped away
              from the desk, did some walking bouncing on a swiss ball, push ups etc... just to get my body
               moving. This helped my brain come up with some solutions that surprised me.
              <br><br>
              This experiment was to make the connection (for me) that the hardware of the brain is just 
              as important as the software. I've oftened tried to "out think" problems instead of recharging 
              my hardware first. Getting a good night sleep then coming back to a problem...*chef's kiss* 
            </p>

              I like to think of my brain is a suitcase with all those travel stickers.
              By constantly learning new things it's like a new sticker / badge. I suggest you should always
              be learning new things and then share that with others in your life. Non tech stuff I have learned this year:<br><br>
              So much about babies and birth <br>
              How to drill concrete and put up a fence<br>
              How to prune tall tress <br>
              How to patch a roof (kinda) <br>
              How to train dogs <br>
              50+ new recipes<br><br>
              I also dream more when I learn a new skills

          <p class="question-heading">Growth Mindset</p>
            <p>
              Back in the 90s, affirmations were all the rage. Self help books were flowing and everyone was 
              all about self-improvement. A big part of that was positive self talk and affirmations. <br>
              Looking at the mirror  and saying "I am successful, I will have a good day", etc... <br>
              I like to think of it like the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. Once you see something / recognize it,
              it appears everywhere. You know when you buy a car and then that model appears everywhere?<br>
              Like that, but for winning and success. That's the growth mindset. <br>
              Your belief system is very powerful. Try for a second to think about something political. A 
              view point you have that you hold dearly. Now, think that you are wrong about that point. <br>
              Just tell yourself with your voice / even out loud. Try convince yourself that you are wrong.<br> <br>
              How did that feel? <br>
              Could you even do it? <br>
              Did your belief system overwrite your thought? <br><br>
              Your internal belief system controls want you think you can or cannot do. It is so important how you
              talk to yourself. Always make sure to be kind (but honest) to yourself. <br> <br>
              Henry Ford said this (I believe):<br>
              “Whether you think you can, or you think you can't – you're right.” <br>
              How cool is that?
